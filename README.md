------
This package fits the far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distribution (SED) to extract dust surface density and various physical parameters of dust using the modified blackbody model. This is part of the codes used in the project "z=0 multi-wavelength galaxy survey" (z0mgs).

This fitting method is originally developed in [Gordon et al. (2014)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...797...85G).
